# -Re-Training
This repository purpose is for (re)do some courses and exercises, just to get in "shape" from time to time.
Or in some cases, I just ignore introductions of some courses, like how to install environment of python, introduction to some libraries like numpy, pandas.
But later if I need the certification, I come back and do some of the exercises and part of scripts in those videos classes.

The organization in this repository will mainly be a folder with "course-name", and inside them i'll explain the plataform of course, date that i did it, and maybe why i did it back then.
